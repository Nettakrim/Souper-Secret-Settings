Vanilla shaders use the name they have in files

Expanded Shaders are builtin with Souper Secret Settings, but may need to be enabled in resourcepacks

[Perspective](https://modrinth.com/mod/mclegoman-perspective) adds its own shaders which soup can recognise, although some need to be enabled in resource packs (marked with *), this list may be outdated
